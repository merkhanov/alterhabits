Implemented Vercel Web Analytics for Next.js

Successfully installed and configured @vercel/analytics package for this App Router Next.js project.

## Changes Made:

### 1. Package Installation
- Installed `@vercel/analytics` using npm
- Updated package.json and package-lock.json with the new dependency

### 2. Analytics Integration
Modified: `src/app/layout.tsx`
- Added import statement: `import { Analytics } from "@vercel/analytics/next"`
- Added `<Analytics />` component inside the `<body>` tag after `{children}`

## Implementation Details:

The project uses Next.js App Router (app directory), so the Analytics component was added to the root layout file (src/app/layout.tsx) as per Vercel's documentation. The component is placed at the end of the body tag to ensure it doesn't interfere with the page content rendering.

## Testing:

✅ Build completed successfully with `npm run build`
✅ TypeScript compilation passed without errors
✅ Linting check passed for the modified file (no new errors introduced)
✅ Project structure preserved - only necessary changes added

## Files Modified:
- package.json (added @vercel/analytics dependency)
- package-lock.json (updated with new dependency tree)
- src/app/layout.tsx (added Analytics import and component)

The Vercel Web Analytics is now ready to track page views and web vitals when deployed to Vercel.
